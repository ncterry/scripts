Here are standard shell scripts:
---------------------------------------------------------
./pingsweep.sh - this asks the user to enter a 3-part subnet such
	as   10.0.2  and it will then take that subnet and add a
	dot(1:254) so that it will then ping everything on that 
	network, 10.0.2.1   10.0.2.2   ...   10.0.2.254
